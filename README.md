# NYC Coronavirus (COVID-19) data

This repository contains data on coronavirus (COVID-19) in New York City (NYC). I am turning [the upstream data from the NYC Department of Health](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data), which contains a count of current cases, into a historical dataset, by reading from their Git history.
